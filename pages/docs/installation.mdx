# Installation

To work on this application locally, you will need to get API Keys of few services.

- [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) - Database and authentication. The database schema is available in the `types_db.ts` file.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) - Payment processing (for subscriptions). You will need to create a product and a price for it. In future, we will add a way to disable this feature for self-hosted instances.
- [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) - Redis database for caching
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) - For their AI models lineup.
- [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com/) - For their AI models lineup too.

2. After you have all the keys, you can copy the `.env.example` and rename it to `.env.local`. Then, fill in the keys in the file.

3. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

4. Run the development server

   ```bash
    pnpm dev
   ```
